Part of week 6 assignment

Code we added/modified can be found -> [GitHub](https://github.com/HolyTrie/TileMaps/tree/main/Assets/Scripts/Pickup) </br> and [GitHub](https://github.com/HolyTrie/TileMaps/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Pickup/KeyboardMoverByTile.cs)

## Part1 - </br>
Try Demo on [itch.io](https://holytrie.itch.io/tilemapsp-1) </br>
We added 3 objects the player can pick up that will allow him to do different things- </br>
* Goat - can climb mountains
* Pickaxe - can turn mountains to grass
* Boat - can be on water

## Part2 - </br>
Try Demo on [itch.io](https://holytrie.itch.io/tilemapsp-2) </br>
We altered the BFS algorithm provided to count unique tiles that are reachable and walkable, </br>
to make sure that the player will not be placed on a mountain. </br>
